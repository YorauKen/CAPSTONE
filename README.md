## Generative Stylist Assistant for Indian Ethnic wear


### Project Overview
The Generative Stylist Assistant is an AI-powered application that allows users to generate Indian ethnic wear designs based on textual descriptions. Users can input prompts that describe features such as color, fabric, design type, and type of ethnic wear. The application then generates a visual representation of the outfit and fetches similar products that closely match the generated image, offering a seamless integration of AI-based design and product discovery.

### Features
* Text-to-Image Generation: Generate images of Indian ethnic wear based on detailed text descriptions.
* Product Recommendation: Fetch and display similar products that closely match the generated outfit.
* Customization: Users can tailor the description to generate specific designs, colors, and fabrics.
